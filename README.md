# AequilibriumApp

This project is for demonstrating the Aequilibrium Assignments:

Part 1: The Castle Company

This part includes simple UI to generate a random land with a maximum size 20, each height is maximum 5

* Because the castleAnalyzer function not only calculate the num of castles, it also shows what Peaks are , what Valleys are. Then I think there is one case that the assignment didn't cover. If land is [2,2,2,2], we don't know it's a peak or valley. so in this project I assumed this is valley

Test cases:
1. [1,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,2,2,2,1]
2. [1,1,1,1,1,1]
3. [2,4,4,4,4,2]
4. [3,3,4,4,3,1,3,1,2,2]
5. [3,3,3,1]
6. [3,3]
7. [3]

Part 2:
